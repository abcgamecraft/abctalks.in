                            information such as your device

                            <p class="text">Cookies:-</p>

                            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique
                            identifiers. These are sent to your
                            browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
                            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party
                            code
                            and libraries that use “cookies”
                            to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or
                            refuse these cookies and know
                            when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not
                            be
                            able to use some portions of this Service.
