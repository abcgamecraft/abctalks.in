                            If you are an Entrepreneur, odds are at some point you were interested in seeking an
                            Investment Partner
                            for your business. Entrepreneurs benefit from Investment Partnerships with more than just
                            injections of capital.
                            Normally, Investment Partners bring business expertise and professional contacts as well.
                            Entrepreneurs face major challenges finding appropriate investors who are inclined to review
                            Entrepreneurs' business proposals and provide funding. In fact, it's such a 'rare' and
                            'interesting' phenomenon
                            that there are now several TV shows like Shark Tank that focus on the initial investment
                            meetings of Entrepreneurs
                            and Investors.
                            Those programs select Entrepreneurs based on how good their pitch will look on TV, not on
                            the merits
                            of their businesses. Further, those Entrepreneurs have LIMITED OPTIONS because they must
                            partner
                            with a 'hand-picked' group of five greedy Investors when the world has many more of business
                            investors with
                            the capital and expertise to take their businesses to the next level quickly and easily.

                            This is why we're creating a venue that connects Entrepreneurs and Investors. We envision
                            ABC TALKS
                            as a Social Network that facilitates matches between Entrepreneurs and appropriate
                            Investors.
                            Here, Investors have the opportunity to promote their skills, background, and project
                            history as they see fit,
                            protecting their personal identity during the initial stages of communication with
                            Entrepreneurs.
